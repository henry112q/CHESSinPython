Make sure it is relvant and do not Push to main for any large alterations
instead push to the Authrisation branch where it will be checked, 
the file potentially renamed and potentially pushed to main depending on whether it fits
if **ANYONE** Commits to main without required consent or thier additions includes changes to main and it is not noticed the repo **will** be rolled back to a past commit
